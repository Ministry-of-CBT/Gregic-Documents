Gregification is a process where an individual devotes time to Gregic modpacks such as GTNH, Supersymmetry, TerraFirmaGreg New Horizons, TerraFirmaRescue, Nomifactory CEu Hard Mode, and more. 

The Process of Gregification is divided into stages.

Each Gregification Stage corresponds to increasing levels of Greg on the personality, the moral code, and the values and actions of such individual.
